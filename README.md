## This React application takes components and randomizes them on the screen while logging which images have been clicked and updating the score. If an image is clicked more than once the game restarts. With each click each image is randomly moved to a different place on the screen.

## Images are stored in a JSON file and accessed using props

## The images state is updated with every click
